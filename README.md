What's good about ZMK dongles?
`- Almost immediate connection and wake-up from sleep mode.
`- No more dependent from less stable Bluetooth connections.
`- Extended battery life for both splits/peripherals.
`- "Wireless" support for ZMK studio, able to change keymaps on the fly.

Surely there's something bad?
`- Extra cost for a spare MCU, seeeduino nrf52840 sense in my case here.
`- Takes an extra USB slot on your device.
